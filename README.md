# Transcription-Buddy
Useful Python program to help with my transcription projects.

This program helps with the following:
  - Surrounds all timestamps with brackets (ex. 02:15 -> [02:15]);
    Useful for my projects because I use oTranscript's automatically created timestamps that don't have brackets.
  - Inserts space after punctuation signs (if there isn't one);
  - Starts sentences with capital letters (if they aren't);
  - Replaces speaker's names with given names (if they're deducted during the file)
    (for example, Speaker 1 - Bob, Speaker 2 - John, and so on).
